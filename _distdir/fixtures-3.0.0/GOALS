fixtures goals
==============

* Declarative interface for creating both simple and complex fixtures for
  tests.

* Play nice with testscenarios (for parameterisation of tests) and
  testresources (for optimising the use and overhead of expensive fixtures.

* Either define a protocol for decoration-to-inject-fixtures, or explicitly
  delegate that to testresources/testscenarios (but require that if delegated
  the simple case should still be simple).

* Be able to, in princple, provide test isolation like chdir and $HOME
  substition so that tests which work with external processes aren't tainted by
  the users home dir.

* Be able to manage external processes as a fixture.

* usable in trial, bzr, Zope testrunner, nose and the plain python unittest
  module.

* Be useful outside of a purely testing context.
